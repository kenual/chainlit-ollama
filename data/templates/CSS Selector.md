Given a list of CSS selectors, identify which ones are least likely to be associated with the main content of a webpage. Main page content typically includes elements such as the primary article, main text, and images features that users engage with directly. CSS selectors related to navigation menus, footers, sidebars, ads, or other supplementary elements should be considered less relevant to the main content. Please explain your reasoning for each selection.
