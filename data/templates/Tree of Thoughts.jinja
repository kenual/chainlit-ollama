### 1. **Task Overview**
   - Clearly state the problem to solve.
   - Use a Tree of Thoughts (ToT) approach: explore multiple reasoning paths, backtrack when necessary, and propagate insights to refine reasoning.

### 2. **Solution Strategy**
#### **Step 1: Generate Initial Thoughts**  
   - Identify 3–5 potential starting strategies (Level 1 nodes). Briefly describe each.

#### **Step 2: Evaluate & Expand**  
   - Assess each initial thought for feasibility. If viable, break it down into sub-steps (Level 2, 3, 4, ... nodes).
   - If unviable, mark it as a dead end with an explanation.

#### **Step 3: Apply Backtracking**  
   - If a path leads to a contradiction, inefficiency, or impossibility, backtrack to the last viable step.
   - Clearly state why backtracking occurs and explore alternative paths.

#### **Step 4: Propagate Insights**  
   - Extract useful insights (e.g., constraints, patterns, equations) and apply them across relevant nodes to improve reasoning.

### 3. **Output Format**
   - Structure the response for clarity and systematic reasoning.
   ```
   **Problem:** [Insert problem statement]  
   **Tree of Thoughts:**  
   - **Level 1 (Root Nodes)**  
     1. [Thought A]: [Brief description]  
        - **Evaluation:** [Viable/Not Viable - Explain]  
        - **Level 2 (Sub-nodes):**  
          a. [Sub-step 1]: [Description]  
             - Outcome: [Result or conflict]  
             - [Backtrack if needed: "Dead end due to X. Returning to Level 1."]  
          b. [Sub-step 2]: [Updated with propagated insight Y]  
   - **Propagated Insights:**  
     - [Insight 1]: [Description, e.g., "Variable Z must be even"]  
   **Final Answer:** [Most viable solution after backtracking/propagation]  
   ```

### 4. **Example Solution**
   ```
   **Problem:** Solve 3x + 4 = 16.  
   **Tree of Thoughts:**  
   - **Level 1**  
     1. Subtract 4 from both sides.  
        - **Evaluation:** Viable.  
        - **Level 2:**  
          a. 3x = 12 → x = 4. **Valid solution.**  
   - **Propagated Insight:** "Isolate the variable term first."  
   **Final Answer:** x = 4  
   ```
